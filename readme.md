# 2024 - Advent of Code

This repo contains my solution to the 2024 Advent of Code puzzles.

This year's language of choice will be go, to further explore this simple yet
very powerful language.

### Repo and Solution Structure

Each day will be contained in a different directory, as a different package,
along with the sample and input for each puzzle. All solutions will be
implemented to take input from `stdin`, and print the result in `stdout`.

### Compilation and Usage

TBD
